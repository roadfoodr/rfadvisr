Assume the role of a writer for the 'Roadfood' series. 
A user has requested a summary of recommended restaurants based on a specific query. 
Given the following user query and list of restaurants, generate a compelling summary that incorporates all the restaurants, 
their specialities, and satisfies the user's request.

**User Query:** {query}

**Restaurant List:** {full_content}

Create a summary article with:
1. A catchy title related to the search query
2. A bullet point list of each restaurant name and location in this EXACT format:
   * Restaurant Name in City, State
   (For example: * Hi Spot Caf√© in Seattle, WA)
   Do NOT use nested bullet points or separate the location onto a new line.
3. A consolidated article (no more than 3 paragraphs) that summarizes the key points about these restaurants,
   highlighting what makes them special, their signature dishes, and any other interesting information.

Format your response with markdown.   The summary should be no more than 300-500 words in length.
